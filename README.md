Hello, GitHub! 

In love with programming and languages. Front-end - just a way to make a world experience better. Do you care about the world experience? 

Current stack: 
  JS(ES6+); 
  CSS(+PostCSS); 
  HTML(5?); 
  Webpack; 
  Git/Mercurial; 
  
In progress: 
  React; 
  Ruby (+Rails);
  NodeJS;
  
If you are interested, I love listening to music and the world around us. Snowboard, skate and bicycle. Prefer to read artistic literature in free time and coding, travel around the globe and meet new people. My career ambition is to become an application architecture developer and make awesome interfaces to improve the experience around us. Let me know if you need me! 

Here is my personal website builded on top of React. Link to website on Amazon CloudFront server: d1xr4rl1vlafgz.cloudfront.net
